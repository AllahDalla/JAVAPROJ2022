Search through the files and remove unnecessary comments and 'System.out.println' . Some of them are unnecessary. They can stay if you can't bother to remove them. The Text UI is working now, it can read a file of your choice or you can choose the sample input file from the assignment pdf by default. Everything works except "Advancing and Validating logs". Advancing does advance the trains and time but it does not show that the current stations have been changed. For the comments that should be there for each function, the previous project has most of them, so they can be copied into the new project. If anymore queries, you can contact me.
